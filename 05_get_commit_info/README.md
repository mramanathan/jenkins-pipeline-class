## Get the shorter version of the SHA id for the commit pointed to by the HEAD

Hint:
1. Check the `git rev-parse` help to get the exact command.

2. Use the [`sh`](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#sh-shell-script) step to execute the command.

NOTE:
It is possible to get the commit id using the [`checkout`](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-scm-step/#checkout-general-scm) step too.
