## What's the content in that text file?

Hint:
1. Create a simple ASCII text file in this folder using the [`writeFile`](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/#writefile-write-file-to-workspace) step.

2. Read and store the file content using [`readFile`](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/#readfile-read-file-from-workspace) step.

3. Use `println` or `echo` to access the value in a variable.
